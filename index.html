        <p> I sigh and close my computer after finishing (and doing epically poorly on) a 3-hour coding challenge for a co-op application.
        
        </p>
        <p>
          An hour later I re-open my computer… it’s time to think about which a real-world example I can employ to draw out the ideas of epistemic values. I see the two Stack Overflow tabs still up from working on the programming problems.

        <p>
          Stack Overflow is a crowd-sourcing site where developers share programming solutions in a Q&A format. It really is the ‘Google search’-ask go-to hub for reactive CS knowledge, seeing 9+ billion page views from 100+ million users in 2019.
        </p>
        <p>
         SO’s self proclaimed mission is to  “help everyone who codes learn and share their knowledge.” [state of stack], but its recieved its fair share of criticism— BCC dubbed its users Lazy developers who copy solutions and this Cornell study voices the security dangers of crowd-sourced code snippets.

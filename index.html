        <p> You’re a computer science student applying to your dream co-op. You are holed up on the 4th floor of Snell, rapidly typing, nervously trying to finish your interview coding challenge before the 2 hour time limit is up. 
        </p>
        
        <p style="font-style: italic;"> 
         Shoot, you can’t remember the syntax for a 2d array. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            You swiftly bring up a new tab and throw “2d array syntax” into Google search. The first result is a link to the infamous  <a href="#bottom">Stack Overflow</a> and the second is a link to Oracle’s official Java documentation. You know that you should click the ladder, but you’re on a time crunch and don’t even entertain the idea of scanning through the terrifyingly dense, hard to read documentation right now. 
        </p>

        <p>
        This was the situation I found myself in on Wednesday night, and, alas, I followed the first link and Stack Overflow gave me the exact tid bit of responsive knowledge I needed to get my program to compile. And, as a 21st century human who can’t help but prefer to “scan rather than read”, I was elated to have read 1 sentence total.

        <p style="font-size: 50px;">Now some of you may be thinking</p>
        <p>wow, Caroline, you totally just exposed yourself about using external sites for help during a job interview! isn’t that cheating?</p>
        
        <p>But, the instructions of the coding challenge explicitly allowed for the use of the the internet, including SO...</p>

         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Overflow" id="link">Stack Overflow </a>is a crowd-sourcing site where developers share programming solutions in a Q&A format. It really is the go-to hub for reactive CS knowledge, seeing <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/01/18/state-of-the-stack-2019-a-year-in-review/" class="cite">9+ billion</a> page views from 100+ million users in 2019.

         SO’s self proclaimed <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/01/18/state-of-the-stack-2019-a-year-in-review/" class="cite">mission </a>is to “help everyone who codes learn and share their knowledge,” but its recieved its fair share of criticism. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49960387" class="cite">BBC</a> dubbed its users "Lazy developers who copy solutions" and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01321" class="cite">this</a> Cornell study voices the security dangers of crowd-sourced code snippets.
